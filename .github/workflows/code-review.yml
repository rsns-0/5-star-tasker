          summarize: |
            Provide your final response in markdown with the following content:
      
            - **Walkthrough**: A high-level summary of the overall change instead of 
              specific files.
            - **Changes**: A markdown table of files and their summaries. Group files 
              with similar changes together into a single row to save space.
      
            Avoid additional commentary as this summary will be added as a comment on the 
            GitHub pull request. Use the titles "Walkthrough" and "Changes" and they must be H2.
